1
00:00:00,465 --> 00:00:05,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think last time you told me that there are different kinds of public primary and secondary schools.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,733
[SPEAKER_00]: There's SK and SJKC.

3
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:11,535
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of school did you attend?

4
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:14,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended SJKC for primary.

5
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:19,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's Chinese national type school.

6
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:19,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

7
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:27,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And I attended SMK for my secondary school.

8
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what's SMK?

9
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:33,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's like the default secondary school system.

10
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:33,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

11
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:37,500
[SPEAKER_01]: SMK is just like SK but with an M in it.

12
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,943
[SPEAKER_01]: M stands for Menengah, which is secondary.

13
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:42,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, okay.

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's the same as SK.

15
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:44,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

16
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:45,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.

17
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:51,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you also told me that these different schools have different language of instruction.

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the language of instruction at your primary school and your secondary school?

19
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,480
[SPEAKER_01]: My primary school was predominantly Mandarin.

20
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was done in Mandarin.

21
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:02,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned Malay in Mandarin.

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned English in English, actually.

23
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:07,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really depends on who's teaching you.

24
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:18,055
[SPEAKER_01]: But math, science, we even had like, we had 道德 as a subject, like moral.

25
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:24,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, is it like Confucius?

26
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because at the end of the day it's still a national syllabus, right?

27
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:47,095
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone decided in the government that we need to have moral education as a subject in schools and I had that from

28
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:54,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Primary one all the way to like secondary school every year.

29
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:59,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like moral education Whatever that means I don't
