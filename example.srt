1
00:00:00,831 --> 00:00:02,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, I wouldn't say so.

2
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:08,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, close in the sense that it's still within the vicinity of the greater Kuala Lumpur area, right?

3
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:11,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what we would call the Kuala Lumpur Valley.

4
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:16,579
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it would take at least like 30 to 40 minutes drive by car to get there.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:17,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most places I can get to within like 40 minutes by car in KL.

7
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:27,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Driving, yeah.

8
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:34,551
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're in KL, when you go to other places, you mostly drive instead of taking public transport?

9
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:40,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, although when I went to school, I took the train a lot.

10
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:44,044
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was still developing, right?

11
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:50,809
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when I was in what we call secondary school, we had the, we had an LRT.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why this stands for a light rapid, light rail transit.

13
00:00:56,934 --> 00:01:01,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would take that to school every day just because the traffic was really bad.

14
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:02,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

15
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:09,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but still the station would be like a 20 minute 15 to 20 minute drive from my place.

16
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:10,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

17
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:18,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, actually, if you wake up earlier, um, and you drive all the way to like all the way downtown, it's.

18
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:20,858
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.

19
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:22,780
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the traffic was really bad.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we ended up doing public transport.

21
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:30,049
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was 18, I think we had the new MRT.

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of changed things.

23
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:37,919
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think transportation is getting better, but it's still a very predominantly car dependent society.
